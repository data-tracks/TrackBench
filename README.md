# 🏎️ TrackBench (formerly *MMDSPBenchmark*)

TrackBench is a benchmarking suite designed specifically to test the performance and efficiency of stream processing systems under diverse workloads.

The suite focuses on evaluating how systems handle varying data structures, volumes, velocities, and complexities. It simulates real-world scenarios with heterogeneous workloads, providing valuable insights into system capabilities for managing high-frequency and high-complexity data streams.

With a flexible and easy-to-configure set of tools, TrackBench is ideal for assessing the limits of advanced stream processing systems.
